🛠️ Using fetch API with React

🛠️ Conditional rendering with React

🛠️ Using SetTimeOut for timing the fetch request

🛠️ Learned more about UI design (Gradients)

🛠️ Learned how to use Headless UI for handling conditional rendering animation

🛠️ Learned more about styling with React


What I could've done better here is:

✔️ Better conditional rendering using the ternary operator

✔️ Isolating components in a better way
